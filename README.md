# sign-up-form

In this project, I'll be creating my first simple sign-up form using HTML components and CSS styles. Additionally, I'll implement constraints for functionality and client-side validation.

The styles are optimized for desktop screens larger than 1015x695 px (Chrome Dev Tools). I plan to address this in a future update by adding mobile responsiveness. Moving forward, I'm excited to continue learning new features!
